This file aims to analyze battery aging (capacity, charged/discharged energy, etc.) and to gather all the tools necessary for modeling (ICA/dQ/dV analysis, DRT, etc.).
Additionally, this code provides functions for generating clean plots for EIS, capacity versus voltage, and other related analyses.

The data used in this study are not publicly available, as they are part of the SSB project.

Please contact the author of this code for any questions or comments.
